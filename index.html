		<h2>Pastry 🍰</h2>
		<p>I started baking at the age of 5 with my mom. Whenever we had the opportunity to make cakes (birthdays, dinner with friends etc...) we did it together. As I grew up I started to try to make more complicated pastries like strawberries, Paris-Brest or pies. Real passion for me, pastry is now 100% part of my daily life.

		<h2>Fashion 👜 </h2>
		<p>
		 I love baking but I am also passionate about fashion. My favorite brand is Jacquemus. I especially like their very original bags. It's a French fashion brand that embodies simplicity. The brand also defends a lot the LGBTQ+ cause which I find very admirable from them.
